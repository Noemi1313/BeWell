# Be Well

Be Well is a project idea to tackle the constant increase of mental health-related cases during the pandemic.

The goal of Be Well is to help an individual identify their state of mind and emotions, as well as the actions that lead to that state of mind.

This is achieved by asking the user to answer questionnaires, representing data related to their emotions over time, speech recognition, among other features.

The app contains four main features:

1. *Questionnaires.* The user is asked several questions about their feelings, activities, sleeping routine, eating habits, and more to map the user's state of mind at that moment.
2. *Calendar and graphs.* The user can see the data they logged in each day, and they can see graphical representations of that data. This way the user can identify their patterns with the intent of getting help they need it.
3. *Resources.* A list of important contacts, addresses, and more so the user can contact help when needed.
4. *Voice Recognition.* The app listens for certain trigger words related to mental health so when a trigger word is heard, the app can try and help you through these tough times.

These features were implemented so the user can understand how they are feeling and help them realize when they need to seek help.
